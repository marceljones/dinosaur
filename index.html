          I like to eat meat, all kinds of meat. That is one thing I have in
          common with my favorite dinosaur. There is more about my favorite
          dinosaur on this page.

      <h2>All about the TRex Dinosaur</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          This is a TRex dinosaur. It is my favorite dinosaur because it is the
          most feared. It will consume any and all things in its path, including
          me. With that said, I'm not sure why this is my favorite dinosaur.
